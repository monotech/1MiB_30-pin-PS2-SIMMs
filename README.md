1MiB 30-pin PS/2 Proprietary SIMMs
----------------------------------

These are standard 1MiB 30-pin SIMMs, that have the option to change them to PS/2 Proprietary type, as used in the motherboards of the Model 30-286 and Model 50, IBM Caching SCSI card, and IBM Multifunction Adapter for Model 30-286.

Documentation is on the rear silkscreen. Use a soldering iron and solder sucker to change between Standard mode and PS/2 mode.

These take nine rare TC511000BFTL chips. They are an odd package. The schematic will work for other modules; you'll just need to change the symbol to match whatever package you'll be using, and to hand-solder, you won't be able to use SOJ ICs in the usual arrangement; you'll need to make the modules larger.
